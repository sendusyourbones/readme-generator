## Description
This application was built to help simplify and speed up the process of writing a high-quality README file with all of the necessary sections of information. Rather than having to look up or memorize which components are needed in a README, developers can focus on coding and then use this application to prompt them to provide all of the information that is needed.
## Table of Contents
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)
* [Questions](#questions)
## Usage
1. cd into the repository in the command line and enter ```node index```
2. Respond to each prompt as it appears in the command line
3. Once you respond to the final question, a ```README.MD``` file should appear in the directory you are in
